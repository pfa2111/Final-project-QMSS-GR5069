The data set of the final project is "electoral_chile.csv". The dictionary of the variables is "Dictionary.xlsx". Please let me know if you have any question about the variables.

# Research question

What is the effect of cognitive skills on political participation? Are more able students more likely to vote compared to less able students? For a longer discussion of this question, and for a quick review of the current research on the subject, please skim cognitive-skills-electoral-PA-DRAFT.pdf, which is a first draft of paper using this data set. 

For this project, we can focus in two substantive issues. First, we can see whether test scores explains political participation, which is an "explain" type of question. Second, we can try to estimate a predictive model of political participation. I have more experience with the "explain" type of research, but I would be thrilled to learn more about prediction.
