# Data

This folder contatins two data sets. In the folder "raw", we included the data with all the observations. More specifically, we included eveety student who took the PSU test in 2007, regardless of the age. Indeed, there is the possibility that some older people had taken the test in 2007, since there is no age restrictions. For instance, a person who finished high school at the age of 30 may have taken the test. 

We decided to restrict the sample to students who were born betwen 1988 and 1991 and who finished high school in 2007, since our substantive focus is to study determinants of electoral participation among the youth. The data set that restricts the sample to this subset is located in the folder "processed".
